## üìö Fundamentals

A geometric transformation, also known as a transformation in the plane or movement in the plane, is a function that makes each point in the plane correspond to another point in the same plane, which is called an image. In general, a transformation is a geometric operation that makes it possible to find or construct a new figure from one that has been initially given. The new figure is called homologous or transformed of the original one.

When working with geometric transformations, it is important to take into account the notation to be used. Thus, if A is a point in the Œ± plane to which a transformation T is applied, then A', which also belongs to the Œ± plane, is its homolog or transformed if there exists such an application that converts A into A'. We will note this as follows:      

`T (A) = A'`

Transformations can be classified into two main groups:

- <ins>Direct:</ins> If the homolog retains the orientation of the original.

- <ins>Inverse:</ins> If the homolog has the opposite direction to the original.

Geometric transformations can also be classified according to the shape of the homologous with respect to the original. In this case, there are three main groups:

- <ins>Isometric:</ins> The homolog preserves the distances and angles. This group is also known as movements in the plane.

- <ins>Isomorphic:</ins> The homolog preserves the shape and angles. Therefore, there is proportionality between the sides of the homologous and the original.

- <ins>Anamorphic:</ins> The shape of the original figure changes.

## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Implementation

The development of this practice allows the user through a simple interface of options to perform different geometric transformations in the 2D plane from the introduction of a series of coordinates to finally obtain the result of applying the selected transformation with the entered coordinates.


## üöÄ Build the project

1. Clone the repository using git with `git clone https://github.com/BrianSuarezSantiago/2D-Geometric-Transformations.git` command or download from [Source Code.](https://github.com/BrianSuarezSantiago/2D-Geometric-Transformations/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

2. Move to the directory where you have the code.

3. Compile and execute the source code using the `python3 2D_Geometric_Transformations.py` command.
